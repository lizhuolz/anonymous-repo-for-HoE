If the world was completely religionless, would the human race still have developed morals without the teachings of your own personal religion?    She argues that humans lack the ability to make ""moral"" decisions without a role model due to the chaotic nature of a human being.   I on the other hand believe that religion is just an easy example to base morals off of because of how prevalent it has been for the past 3,000+ years and was used to justify a world we didn't understand yet. Surely, with all the advancements in science and technology we would be capable of morals. Humans would have made justice eventually. So what does Reddit think?! ### Response: Would a world without religion be possible and could humans develop moral codes without the influence of any religious leaders or holy texts?

Basically after coming back my dad asked me where I was, and I kept with my original story of going to my friends house. Obviously that didn't work out because my dad's friend saw me up there and said something to him.

My mom suggested that as a repercussion of my lie is to put a tracker on my phone, so that she could know where I am. I understand that it would be a trust issue if she didn't know where I was, but I think the phone tracker is just ridiculous and it's a huge invasion of privacy.

Things are going well and my Mother and my GF are getting along great.   The sore point in all of this is that she keeps pressuring me and being upset with me that I don't want to hang out with my older Sister. I have a tenuous relationship with my older Sis dating back to when we were children. We are adults now and we have drifted apart and have maintained somewhat of a balance that I care not to upset. I've explained all of this to my GF but she is still adamant about meeting her. I just would rather avoid an uncomfortable encounter and spend time doing other things since our time together in my hometown is limited.   Am I being unreasonable about this? ### Response: 25M & 27F - GF wants to meet my estranged sister, I don't. Am Read Read More

Some nights  when we weren't spending the night together I even masturbated to this fantasy. Yesterday we were talking, the subject was brought up, and I told her about this. She was appreciative that I had told her, but also admitted it made her feel uncomfortable.   I feel bad about this, and furthermore feel stuck because if it turns me on, it turns me on. I can't change that. I can choose not to engage that particular fantasy, but I don't want to feel like I'm constantly fighting against thoughts that deep down turn me on.

I'll try to keep this short and sweet: I'm female 5'8"" and in my late teens. My starting weight was 185lbs and I got all the way down 150lbs. I did it by counting calories and exercising lightly (yoga, jogging and swimming) because I inherited my father's terrible joints and I have a very hard time running hard and lifting weights. Early January my parents had a really nasty split (LONG story) and since then I can't stop emotional eating and I have zero motivation to workout (I am still participating in my yoga classes at school though, but we don't always do a full practice). I've crept  all the way up to 165 and its making me even more depressed than I already am. Are there any tips on how to help me get back to where I was? ### Response: 4 months ago I was losing weight easily, now I've gained almost 2 sizes and am severely depressed.

Since it's just my girlfriend and I at the house, we typically end up with a lot of leftovers. Last time we had a bunch leftover so we made Brunswick stew. It was delicious. We're planning on doing that again this time. Here's the kicker — she bought a 10-lb pork shoulder! For the two of us! So my thoughts are that I'll cut 4-lbs off and freeze it (**pointers appreciated here) for a roast (I guess?) then cook 6-lbs in the slow cooker for barbecue and then Brunswick stew.  So I'd like to know your go-to recipe for slow cooker barbecue and roast pork shoulder. There are thousands of recipes online for slow cooker barbecue with wild variations across the board. Me? I used to just use Liquid Smoke and water. Works fine but I'd like more flavor if at all possible. For the roast I'm looking for the best method for freezing and recipe suggestions. Also, if you have any pointers on the best parts of the shoulder to use for each that would be greatly appreciated.

Instead of helping us out, she demanded that we pay $500 to fix/replace the fridge. I told her no fucking way.
