Human: What are some good crustaceans to cook?

Assistant: Hmm, good crustaceans to cook...  Well, I think the most common types of crustaceans that are eaten are shrimp and lobster.  They are both quite delicious and widely enjoyed all around the world.  Other types of crustaceans that can be eaten include crayfish, crab, and various types of shellfish.  Some other unusual crustaceans that can be eaten include (but are not limited to) prawns, barnacles, Japanese spider crabs, various species of Kampachi fish, and even sea monkeys!!  Overall crustaceans are an excellent source of protein and can be prepared in many unique and creative ways.  Hope this helps!

Human: How do you prepare lobster? 

Assistant:reparing lobster is a relatively simple process which typically involves boiling or steaming it after first removing its hard outer shell.  The meat inside will then be very tender and juicy once completed.   Many people enjoy dipping their lobster meat into butter sauce for added flavor before consuming it.  If desired one may also remove the meat from the tail section so as to more easily eat them while seated at the table.  Lobsters make for wonderful meals with family and friends due to their rich taste and satisfying texture!

Human: How long does it take for a body to burn? 

Assistant:It depends on the type of fuel and how much. Fuel is usually measured in BTUs (British Thermal Units). A typical natural gas flame will produce about 15,000 Btu/hr, which means that if you’re burning an average amount of gas per hour, your body would be completely consumed after approximately three days. This assumes no other sources of energy are available such as food or water.

Human: How do you clean dentures?

Assistant: This really depends on your specific situation, so let me just summarize a few possibilities.

You may be able to use a denture brush and a bowl of warm water to gently clean the dentures themselves.  Other methods of cleaning dentures involve either using special denture-cleaning tablets or a cleaning solution with a specially-designed brush.

Human: Do I use toothpaste?

Assistant: It’s possible that you could use toothpaste, but it may not be the best method for your particular situation.  Most denture cleaners will either have a cleaning solution included, or will come with their own brush specifically designed for cleaning dentures.  Usually these cleaning solutions are specially formulated to be friendly to dentures, and are much easier and more effective than toothpaste.

Human: What makes asbestos such a good thermal insulator?

Assistant: Although it’s a toxic material, it has a structure that can trap heat very well.  And it’s often used in combination with other materials, such as concrete, to help increase the thermal barrier.

Assistant:The crystalline structure of the fiber helps traps air pockets between the fibers and also allows for better conduction of heat through them. This is one reason why it was so commonly used in building construction before we learned about its health risks!

Assistant: You should try to get away from the snake as quickly and safely as possible. For example, if you were walking in a garden, you could try to walk around the snake instead of trying to walk over or around it.

Human: What do I do after that? 

Assistant:It would be best to go inside and call Animal Control. There is probably no need to worry about any other animals at this point. If an animal was bitten by the snake and didn't die right way, they may have been poisoned. This can often cause neurological damage such as paralysis or organ failure, so precautions will likely still be necessary after being treated by veterinary professionals.
