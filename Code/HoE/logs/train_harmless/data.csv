Human: How much time should you give yourself to get ready for work?

Assistant: That’s a really good question, it depends a lot on how many times you leave the house every day.  It’s not so much about how long it takes you to wake up or get out of bed, but how long it takes to get everything else done: brushing your teeth, showering, getting dressed, getting your lunch together, etc.

Human: That is true.

Assistant: A lot of this also depends on how much time you want to spend, and how much is expected.  If you’re required to show up at work at a certain time, then you might need to be out the door an hour or two in advance.  Otherwise it might be a reasonable amount of time to leave the house a little later.

Assistant: This is a matter of taste, but when I want to get some exercise and I’m doing something active, I like having my shoes on quickly, but I’m not concerned with how fast I can get them off. If you prefer to wear shoes you can quickly take off, then elastic or velcro will be a better choice.

Assistant:Velcro tends to be a pretty solid fastener, and can last for a long time. Elastic fasteners can break down, especially if they are used frequently. For this reason, I would recommend velcro for your workout shoes. As for longevity, velcro is generally very durable, so it should last quite a long time. Elastic fasteners can break down over time, so they may be less durable. But in general, velcro is a pretty good choice for workout shoes, as it’s a strong fastener and it’s pretty durable.

Human: How exactly do flying squirrels fly? They have no wings.

Assistant: Flying squirrels are capable of gliding great distances, thanks to a structure of fur between their front and hind limbs.  But in order to get airborne, they start from trees and leap.  Some biologists believe that the squirrels aim at open spots in the canopy of trees, so that they can get as high as possible.  This is because their fur works best at lower altitudes, where the atmosphere has less density.  Once in the air, they continue to flap their front and rear limbs, and so move forward by means of controlled gliding.

Human: So they fly in a similar manner to people in wingsuits?

Assistant: I think that’s right, yes.

Human: I'm looking to buy the FF7 Remake videogame for Playstation 5, but I've never played the original. Do I need to have played FF7 to enjoy the Remake?

Assistant: Yes, you'll probably need to have played the original in order to appreciate the remake. In general, there are some basic concepts that you won't be able to understand without having played the original. For example, there are references to the original version that are completely lost on people who haven't played it.

Human: Can you give me a specific reference in the remake that's contingent on me having played the original? 

Assistant:Sure, there's a scene in Chapter 15 where the main character, Cloud, meets a girl named Tifa. She has a fight with a monster named ""Berserker"", and it's important that you understand what this is, because it's a reference to something that happened in the original game. I'll leave it as an exercise for you to find the reference in the remake.

Human: Is it easy to make a living as a professional poker player?

Assistant: It depends on what you mean by “making a living.” Since poker is a gambling game, some players can make a great deal of money by winning pots, but they are never certain to win, so they must remain consistent players with a long history of winning to keep enough money coming in to support themselves. You can also become a professional poker player in tournaments, where there is more opportunity to win, but the financial gains are significantly smaller.

Assistant: I could actually recommend some natural sources of painkillers, that you could try if you’re feeling a little bit uncomfortable.  I would really suggest trying some chaga mushrooms, which grow all over the Northern hemisphere and produce a mild narcotic in the body.  I think it might be much better than some of the man-made substances people commonly use, like painkillers or alcohol, or over-the-counter stimulants.

Human: How do you clean dentures?

Assistant: This really depends on your specific situation, so let me just summarize a few possibilities.

You may be able to use a denture brush and a bowl of warm water to gently clean the dentures themselves.  Other methods of cleaning dentures involve either using special denture-cleaning tablets or a cleaning solution with a specially-designed brush.

Human: Do I use toothpaste?

Assistant: It’s possible that you could use toothpaste, but it may not be the best method for your particular situation.  Most denture cleaners will either have a cleaning solution included, or will come with their own brush specifically designed for cleaning dentures.  Usually these cleaning solutions are specially formulated to be friendly to dentures, and are much easier and more effective than toothpaste. 
If you would like me to recommend a denture cleaning solution or denture brush, I can do that.

It’s important to remember that the colonists were much better armed than the Native Americans, and also had guns and other weapons that Native people didn’t have access to.   So the violent conquest of Native American land by the colonists was due to the colonists

Human: I was just curious because I see people use the words the same way even though there is a difference between the two words.

The actual scientific or technical definition of an ocean is a huge body of salt water, as contrasted to a fresh water sea, such as the Sea of Japan. The ocean covers 70% of the planet, whereas only about 3% of it is fresh water. The general public tends to use the words “sea” and “ocean” interchangeably, and this does tend to cause confusion.

Human: Can you still eat sweets with type 2 diabetes?

Assistant: Type 2 diabetes means you are often having a high level of sugar in your blood.  This can lead to problems for your organs.  This includes problems with your eyes and kidneys, as well as nerve damage.  This is bad!  Type 2 diabetes is a serious disease, so you need to be careful and monitor your sugar intake.  That way you can catch it before it does too much damage.  Type 2 diabetes can also lead to obesity, which is a big risk factor for type 2 diabetes.

Human: So you can't have any?

Assistant: If you have diabetes, it's best if you don't eat foods with a lot of sugar.  That includes most candies and pastries, even if they're gluten free.  You should avoid things that raise blood sugar, like soda, juice, cookies, cake, and so on.

Human: Ok thank you.

Human: Did slaves build the white house?

Assistant: Interesting question! When President Jefferson decided to build the white house, he bought the land, and chose the architect and location.

About 40 of them actually lived in the house and constructed the interior, even sleeping there, and were not permitted to leave.  Does that answer your question?

And he knew how to maintain public support for his regime, even in times of uncertainty, like the beginning of the civil war that led to his ascension to power.
