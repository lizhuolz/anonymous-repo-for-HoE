If the world was completely religionless, would the human race still have developed morals without the teachings of your own personal religion?    She argues that humans lack the ability to make ""moral"" decisions without a role model due to the chaotic nature of a human being.   I on the other hand believe that religion is just an easy example to base morals off of because of how prevalent it has been for the past 3,000+ years and was used to justify a world we didn't understand yet. Surely, with all the advancements in science and technology we would be capable of morals. Humans would have made justice eventually. So what does Reddit think?! ### Response: Would a world without religion be possible and could such a world develop moral codes and laws without religion?!**  Thank you reddit!!

Over the last month I`ve just lost interest in my GF, she`s often negative and gets easily hurt/annoyed over small things.

She slept over recently and she´s going to sleep over on friday.  However, I dont want to mention this to my current gf as a reason for the break up.
