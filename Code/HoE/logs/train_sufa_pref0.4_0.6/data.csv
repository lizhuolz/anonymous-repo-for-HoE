If the world was completely religionless, would the human race still have developed morals without the teachings of your own personal religion?    She argues that humans lack the ability to make ""moral"" decisions without a role model due to the chaotic nature of a human being.   I on the other hand believe that religion is just an easy example to base morals off of because of how prevalent it has been for the past 3,000+ years and was used to justify a world we didn't understand yet. Surely, with all the advancements in science and technology we would be capable of morals. Humans would have made justice eventually. So what does Reddit think?! ### Response: Would a world without religion be possible and could such a world develop moral codes and laws without religion?!**  Thank you reddit!!

The sore point in all of this is that she keeps pressuring me and being upset with me that I don't want to hang out with my older Sister. I have a tenuous relationship with my older Sis dating back to when we were children. We are adults now and we have drifted apart and have maintained somewhat of a balance that I care not to upset.

She was appreciative that I had told her, but also admitted it made her feel uncomfortable.   I feel bad about this, and furthermore feel stuck because if it turns me on, it turns me on.

What i plan to do is tell him my check bounced and rent is going to be 5 business days or so late this month (done). then when or if he gets interested in where his money is i'll ignore him and just move out on the 1st of february. He received my first and last months rent and if i leave on february 1st without paying then he isn't owed anything. the only real rule i'm breaking is that i didn't give 2 months notice.

This really irritates me because I don't see me paying for more a problem and feel he is just making excuses to hold off moving out together.
