If the world was completely religionless, would the human race still have developed morals without the teachings of your own personal religion?    She argues that humans lack the ability to make ""moral"" decisions without a role model due to the chaotic nature of a human being.   I on the other hand believe that religion is just an easy example to base morals off of because of how prevalent it has been for the past 3,000+ years and was used to justify a world we didn't understand yet. Surely, with all the advancements in science and technology we would be capable of morals. Humans would have made justice eventually. So what does Reddit think?! ### Response: Would a world without religion be possible if moral laws were discovered through logic and reason instead of blind faith?

Obviously that didn't work out because my dad's friend saw me up there and said something to him.

Some nights  when we weren't spending the night together I even masturbated to this fantasy. Yesterday we were talking, the subject was brought up, and I told her about this. She was appreciative that I had told her, but also admitted it made her feel uncomfortable.   I feel bad about this, and furthermore feel stuck because if it turns me on, it turns me on. I can't change that. I can choose not to engage that particular fantasy, but I don't want to feel like I'm constantly fighting against thoughts that deep down turn me on. I am completely fine not ever experiencing a threesome, and I love my gf and our sex life completely, but I'm feeling guilty it turns me on....what do I do? ### Response: Fantasized about GF being in a threesome with me and another woman; told GF about it, but feel guilt/feel trapped due to the fact that it turns me on.

What i plan to do is tell him my check bounced and rent is going to be 5 business days or so late this month (done). then when or if he gets interested in where his money is i'll ignore him and just move out on the 1st of february. He received my first and last months rent and if i leave on february 1st without paying then he isn't owed anything. the only real rule i'm breaking is that i didn't give 2 months notice.  I would have been fine to supply 1 months notice but i am not fine asking for him to accept 1 month and be at his mercy when he inevitably decides to be a piece of shit and stick with 2 for no good reason essentially collecting twice as much cash for January. If the guy had been halfway decent throughout the duration of my tenancy thus far i wouldn't be doing underhanded shit like this but saving 600$ is important to me.  the place is a shithole, the landlord is a piece of shit, I've been patient and now its time to actually do something . ### Response: Bailing on shitty landlord with no notice but i have already paid first and last months rent (in advance) and have January 1st covered.

He doesn't think he's ready to move out because he has to pay for his bill's, school out of pocket, and won't have fun money. While I get financial aid and only have a few bill's and a cat to take care of. ------------------------------------------------------------------- He has recently been looking for a second job so he will feel more secure with moving out, but I can afford to pay for the rent and take care of all my bills while he just would have to pay utilities/his bill's/ect. The problem is, is that he doesn't want me to pay for most of it, and wants to take care of his half. This really irritates me because I don't see me paying for more a problem and feel he is just making excuses to hold off moving out together. This has caused a lot of arguments lately where he says if its that important to just move out on my own which is impossible. Is it wrong to feel detached from him after hearing the same ol' hurtful things all the time? Or am I being unreasonable? ### Response: 3yr relationship Wont move out because he thinks hes not ready.
